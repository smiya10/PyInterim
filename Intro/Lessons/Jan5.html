    <h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
    <p>To start, enter the interactive shell on <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" target="_blank">repl.it</a>. Like before, you will use this online shell to execute your code. For information on setting up the python shell on your own computer, see Syd's <a href="../../Advanced/Lessons/installpython.html" target="_blank">Installation Instructions</a> until I have the time to write my own or improve his (it's rough if you have a Mac, and pictures would be nice). You do not need to have Python installed on your machine, but it is more convenient.</p>
    
    <h2 id=ex1>Example One - Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>
        The first example will discuss the basic syntax of Python and the basics of variables. It can be found <a href="../Code-Examples/Jan5/01-syntax_example.py">here</a>, but here's an overview of the materials discussed: 
        <ul>
            <li>Comments: Anything after a # is a comment and ignored by the interpreter.</li>
            <li>Imports: You don't need this yet, but imports are used to use someone else's code</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This import says to include the math library, which provides several math functions. The math package is included with Python by default.</li>
                <li>Don't reinvent the wheel.</li>
                <li>This program does not use the math library so it is unnecessary but included for example.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Variables and Assignment: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Variables store data (numbers, strings, etc.)</li>
                <li>Variables are assigned with the assignment operator '='.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignment in form <code>variable = literal</code></li>
                    <li>The literal data on the right side is stored into the variable on the left side.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Literals are data which are not variable (i.e. number 9 or string "hello")
                <li>Variables can change by reassignment</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Displaying Variables - print() Function</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>print()</code> is a function (this will be discussed in more detail soon) which displays data to the user</li>
                <li><code>print()</code> can be used to print a string literal as in <code>print("hello")</code> - note the quotation marks to signify literal</li>
                <li>It can also be used print the value stored in a variable <code>print(variable)</code></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Importance of Tabs</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tabs are non-trivial in Python.</li>
                <li>They signify that multiple lines of code go together.</li>
                <li>For now, all of your code will need to be tabbed the same amount (probably not at all).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Basic Data Types</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Integer: whole numbers (abbrev. "int") like 42</li>
                <li>Floating-Point: decimal numbers (abbrev. "float") like 23.8</li>
                <li>String: collection of characters like "example"</li>
                <li>Boolean: True or False</li>
                <li>There are other basic data types but they are not discussed now (or at all in the case of complex numbers)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        Other notes about syntax:
        <ul>
            <li>Naming convention: Python is lenient on convention for naming variables but the most common is to use lower case words separated by underscores (i.e. <code>this_is_a_variable</code>)</li>
            <ul><li><em>Mixed case</em> is also accepted which starts with a lowercase word and appends all following words with a capital first letter (i.e. <code>thisIsAVariable</code>)</li></ul>
            <li>You may have noticed this already, but capitalization matters. 'hi' is not the same as 'Hi'.</li>
            <li>Comments are important. You may not see it now, but if you ever have to read someone else's code, you'll know. Start good habits now.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="math">Basic Numeric Operations</h2>
    <p>
        Examples of the four basic math functions are shown in the <a href="../Code-Examples/Jan5/02-basic_numerics.py">second example</a>. Here's an overview of the example:
        <ul>
            <li>Basic math functions (+, -, *, /) work the same in Python as in traditional math</li>
            <li>When variables are used to calculate the value of other variables, their current values are used</li>
            <li>Division is weird in other languages, but you don't have to worry about it in Python 3</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Try It Out</h3>
    <p>
        Go ahead and play around with the Python interactive shell on the right. Put in some of the commands from the example script and make up some of your own. The best way to get familiar with Python is to play with it. If you're felling brave, you can write up some scripts and click the run button. Make sure to put print() statements if you want to see what's going on. Here are a some ideas:
    <ul>
        <li>Play around with parentheses and the four basic math functions in combination</li>
        <li>Try putting math inside the print() function.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        See what errors you can get too. You always want to know what not to do. Here are a few to start you off:
        <ul>
            <li>Literal or reserved word on the left of assignment operator '='</li>
            <li>Using a variable that has not been given a value yet</li>
            <li>Multiplying a string by a number (Especially try this one out, just to see one of the oddities of Python)</li>
            <li>Adding strings (This one isn't necessarily an error but it doesn't do what you might expect) - this is called <em>concatenation</em></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="assignment">Basic Math Assignment</h2>
    <p>Your assignment is located <a href="../Assignments/01-basic_math.html">here</a> and is due at the beginning of class next meeting. This class may not count for a grade or anything, but doing the assignments will help you learn the material.</p>
