<h2 id="scripts">Writing Scripts</h2>
<h3>What is a script?</h3>
<p>So far, you hvae written everything interactively (i.e. you type each line and see immediate results). Writing scripts allows you to save and rerun your code. A script is just the code saved as a file instead of written interactively. It's as simple as that. 
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Can be reused</li>
    <li>Runs the exact same code each time it is run</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You cannot immediately see results</li>
    <li>You do not have a second chance to rerun different versions of faulty lines of code</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to run scripts</h3>
<p>So, you've written your code and want to run it as a script. In the online interpreter, just insert it into the left panel and click run. If you have Python installed and in your path variable (Windows), name the file with .py extension and run <kbd>python [filename]</kbd>. Writing scripts is more like what you would do in any producion setting, so you will use this method for any future work.</p>
