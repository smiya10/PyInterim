<h1>Control flow (if, elif, else), conditionals (==, !=, >, etc), boolean operators (and, or, etc), collection logical operators (in)</h1>
<p>Today's class will be an introduction to if...else... statements, conditionals, boolean logic, and the rest of computer decision making. Today will not attempt to combine this material with previous material to avoid confusion, but this will be discussed tomorrow as a review day.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Today's Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Control Flow (<code>if, elif, else</code>)</li>
    <li>Conditionals (<code>==, !=, >,</code> etc)</li>
    <li>Basic Boolean Logic (<code>and, or, not</code>)</li>
    <li>Collection Logical Operator <code>in</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Learn by Example</h2>
<p>I personally learn best by example, so here's a <a href="../Code-Examples/Jan10/01-control_flow.py">highly documented example</a> of conditionals and control flow</p>
