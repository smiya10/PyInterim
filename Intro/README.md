## Licensing?

Nope. This is stuff is completely free. Feel free to use it however you like, just make sure to give us credit. (I don't really care about the credit. I just don't support plagiarism.) Please spread the good news of Python. Go and tell it on the mountains, over the hills, and everywhere.
