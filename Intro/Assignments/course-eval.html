<h1>Intro to Python Course Evaluation</h1>
<p>Thank you for participating in the GSSM Nightly Python in the Interim Class. It has been a pleasure to teach you all. I hope you have learned a lot about Python programming and problem solving in general. I have learned a lot too, both about teaching and Python. In order to continue my learning, I ask that you fill out this quick course evaluation to help me know how to improve my teaching.
