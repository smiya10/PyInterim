<h1>Loops Practice Assignment</h1>
<p>This is a short in class assignment to practice loops. If you have questions, you can ask in class. Good luck.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Write a program which calculates the sum of a list of 5 numbers inputted by the user.</li>
    <li>Do basically the same as the previous program but with a variable number of items in the list. You do not need to have user interaction, but instead write a function which accepts a list and returns the sum of the numbers in the list. You can implement a user interface if you have extra time (you can have the user say "stop" when they are done inputting numbers or ask for the number of items before getting the numbers of the list).</li>
    <li>Write a program which generates a random number between 1 and 100 (including 100, so you'll probably want to do 1 to 101 using the random.randint function). Then ask the user for numbers until the user guesses correctly. On each iteration, tell the user if they are too high or too low. You can use a break to end when the user guesses correctly or use a boolean value to store if the user guessed correctly. (The second option if probably more conventional but either works and the first is simpler.) If you have extra time, include a counter which tells the user how many tries it took.</li>
</ol>
