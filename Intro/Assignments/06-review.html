    <h1>Mid-Class Review Assignment</h1>
    <p>This assignment is coding review of everything we've discussed so far. Anything since the beginning is fair game. Make sure to comment your code. Run your code after you write it to test and debug. Good luck.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Write a function which accepts three numbers, the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism then returns the volume and surface area of the prism. (\( V = l \times w \times h\) and \( SA = 2 \times l \times w + 2 \times l \times h + 2 \times w \times h\)). Test the function first with literal values, then allow the user to input the three values (probably floats) and view the volume and surface area. Make sure to tell the user which output is which.</li>
        <li>Write a function which accepts 3 values. Using Boolean logic (not loops) calculate and return the maximum of the three values. Test the function with literal values, then provide implementation for user input.</li>
        <li>Write a program which accepts two numbers and an operator separated by spaces from the user and then calculates the value requested. (i.e. if the user typed "<kbd>3 + 9</kbd>" it would output <samp>12</samp>). This would be most appropriate implemented as a function, but you don't have to do that for this problem. To start, only implement the four basic operators +, -, *, and /, but you can implement more if the first works and you feel ambitious. For separating the string on spaces, check out the string function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#str.split">split()</a>. Do not worry about the errors that arise from invalid user input - these can only be resolved with stuff we haven't learned yet.</li>
        <li>Write then call a function which accepts a set number of arguments of various types then puts them in a mad lib. Return the mad lib as a single string. You have several choices in putting the items together into a single string (formatting specifiers, format() function, concatenation). In your comments, you can just say the data type since the purpose of the variable is a secret in this case. Ask the user for those variables one-by-one.</li>
