    <h2 id="overview">Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This course is a short Python programming bootcamp during the 2017 GSSM Interim. Python is a popular programming language, known for its ease of use. This course teaches Python as an introduction to programming for this reason. By the end of this course you will have learned the basic syntax of Python and the logical nature of all programming languages. This course is designed for learning Python as a first language, but this course will also help in learning future programming languages (like Java). If you have already learned a programming language and wish to participate in a more advanced course, this will be taught by Syd Miyasaki also during the 2017 Interim.

    <h2 id="philosophy">A Little About Python</h2>
    <p>
        Although it will be covered in more detail, this section briefly describes the philosophy of programming. Computer programming has changed drastically in a short time. Programming languages have been developed to make code easier to develop and less hardware-dependent. Today, there are a wide variety of programming languages to fulfill various needs. This course uses Python because it is easy to learn, but it is necessary to understand the differences between Python and other languages. First, Python is an <em>interpreted</em> language. Unlike <em>compiled</em> languages, the code is not converted to machine code until it is needed. As the a Python program runs, it is interpreted into usable code (because computers only understand binary machine code). This approach is slower than compiled languages, but it allows easier to development in many ways. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another classification of programming languages divides them into <em>paradigms</em>. A paradigm is simply the approach of completing tasks. The two most common are <em>object-oriented</em> and <em>functional</em>. Other paradigms such as <em>rules-based</em> exist, but are less common. Python is <em>multi-paradigm</em> meaning that it supports both functional and object-oriented paradigms. In this course, you will learn what all this means and how to use the functional paradigm of Python. Python as an object oriented language is not covered in this class, only in the advanced class.

        This is meant to be a casual class with no formal grading or homework. It is not an official part of the GSSM Interim, nor does it carry any credit with the Governor's School. The sole purpose of this class is to learn Python. If this is not your motivation, this class is not for you. That being said, this class will assign small projects for homework and a final project. These assignments are not required but highly recommended. The only way to truly learn a programming language is to use it, so please take advantage of these resources. If you don't, this class will probably make a lot less sense to you and you will not enjoy it. If you struggle with any of the assignments, feel free to    contact me (hdamron17@gssm.k12.sc.us) or James (jjohnson18@gssm.k12.sc.us).

    <ul>
        <li>For this course, you are not required to download or install anything on your personal computer. If you have trouble or do not want to install on your computer, there is an online Python interpreter located on a site called <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" target="_blank">repl.it</a>.</li>
        <li>If you want to install Python on your machine, Syd has provided a brief <a href="../Advanced/Lessons/installpython.html" target="_blank">installation manual</a> (it's still rough so I can't make any promises about quality).</li>
        <li>Any information about Python can be found at the <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python website</a> or more specifically in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/" target="_blank">Python API</a>.</li>

        Nope. This is stuff is completely free. Feel free to use it however you like, just make sure to give us credit. (I don't really care about the credit. I just don't support plagiarism.) Please spread the good news of Python. Go and tell it on the mountains, over the hills, and everywhere.
