    <h1>Python Plus</h1>
    <p> 
    This is the syllabus for the advanced python course. <em> I apologize for my poor writing </em> <br>
    <strong>Meeting Location: </strong> TBD <br>
    <strong>Meeting Dates: </strong> Sunday through Thusday January 3 - January 17, 2016 <br>
    <strong>Meeting Time: </strong> TBD <br>
    <strong>Instructor: </strong> Syd Miyasaki <br>
    <p><em>On Python Philosophy (from the Python website):</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. <br>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
    Python is one the most popular programming languages today, among the ranks of JavaScript and C++. One of the main reasons behind Python's popularity is its
    simple and beautiful syntax. Python is so elegant that it's commonly joked that "Python is pseudocode." In this course, we will learn to program in Python and explore the power that Python's simple
    syntax gives us.
    </p>
    <h3>
    <em>Specific Aims: </em> 
    </h3>
    <p>
    By the end of this course, you will be able to write Python code and understand Python's syntax. Specifically, you will be able to declare and initialize variables and use all control flow structures,
    including if statements and loops. You will learn how to handle basic IO, including standard input and output as well as file IO. String manipulation will also be covered. Beyond these basic imperative
    skills, you will also learn to define and call functions and to use lambda expressions. This class will teach you more advanced Python syntax as well, such as iterator syntax, fundamental data structures
    (lists, dicts, etc.), and object-oriented
    programming. For this class, you will complete projects to demonstrate these skills. The first will be for imperative-style and will be nothing more complex than a project in your previous Java-based
    101 course. For the second project, you will incorporate functions and file IO. For the third project, you will use object-oriented design. The details for these projects will be explained later in
    this syllabus.
    </p>
    <h2>Assumptions and Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
    For this class, it assumed that you have completed a 101 level programming course and felt comfortable with the material. If this is not true, it is expected that you will be able to program on such a
    level. As such, I will not spend much time on basic concepts such "what is a variable" and "how do while loops work?" This means that, for the most part, I will teach you syntax and some implications,
    but you are responsible for using the syntax appropriately. If you struggle with any of the ideas, please come see me! This course is not for any credit, you are here to learn. I expect an attitude to
    this effect. This will be a lot of material, but we're going to have fun with it.<br>
    If this seems like too much, and you really want a ground-up approach, see <a href="../Intro/index.html">the intro course</a>.
    I do not know how others will teach this class, but I believe that you should learn these skills as they are used in the real world. Code readability and standard conformance are a major part of that.
    Please, 
    comment your code and use descriptive variable names. This helps me understand your code and helps you think. I will not expect anything of your code that I wouldn't do myself. Beyond simple commenting,
    I expect this class to code in a pythonic manner. This includes some conformance to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">Python style guide</a>. You are not expected to learn this on
    your own: it will be taught in class.<br>
    There is one final point I'd like to discuss. In programming, there are several paradigms, the most popular being imperative, functional, and object-oriented. Many programmers adopt a dogmatic stance on 
    these paradigms, accepting one as the best. I do not. I will teach how to use all three of these at a basic level. They are not cults, they are tools to help us think of solutions. As such, you may use
    whatever style(s) you see fit.<br>
