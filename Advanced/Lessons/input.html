        <p>By the end of this lesson you will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get Input in Python</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Remember, if you have trouble with any of this, come see me! You aren't a bad programmer, but I <em>am</em> a bad writer!</p>
    
    <h2 id="input">Getting Input</h2>
        <p>
        Let's take a breather from the heavy stuff and do something simple but crucial. In the first lesson, you learned how to print things to the console. In this lesson, we will do the opposite--input.<br>
        So let's take a look. Go ahead and type the following code in the interpreter: <br>
        <br>
        <code>
        input("Give me some input: ")
        </code>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> It is <em>essential</em> that you are running Python 3 for this lesson. The input function behaves differently in Python 2.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, you've probably figured out how input works. The string you pass input is the <em>prompt</em> and the return value of input is, quite reasonably, the <em>input</em> as a string. Makes sense,
        right? Now, we can move on to our first in-class project: CopyCat!
        </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> 
        In this lesson, we learned how to get input in python using the input() method. That's all. We're now ready to write our first project!
