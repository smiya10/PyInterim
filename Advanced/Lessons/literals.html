    <h1>Literals in Python</h1>
    <p>
    A <em>literal</em> is any piece of data that is not associated with a specific variable. We've used literals before in our print statements. The text we printed was never given a variable, so it is a 
    string literal. In the Python shell, typing a literal will cause the value of that literal to print.
    </p>
     
        <h2>Types of Literals</h2>
        <p>
        In Python, there are various <em>types</em> of literals. While almost any built-in data type will have a literal form, we are going to focus on the simplest and most common: strings, integers, floats,
        and booleans.
        </p>
            <h3>Strings</h3>
            <p>
            Strings are literals that represent any form of text. If if can be represented by a set of characters, it can be a string. String literals are enclosed by either "double quotes" or 
            'single quotes.'
            </p>
            
            <h3>Integers</h3>
            <p>
            An <em>integer</em> is any number that is not given a decimal part. It is important to note that in Python, that means that 2 is integer whereas 2.0 is not. While the distinction between integers
            and floats, the next type of literal, is usual trivial in Python, there are some operations which can only be performed with integers.
            </p>
             
            <h3>Floats</h3>
            <p>
            A <em>float</em> is any number which <em>does</em> include a decimal. In other languages, this type is often divided into doubles and floats. Python does not make this distinction. As we will see
            in the math section, Python tends to store numbers as floats.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Booleans</h3>
            <p>
            There are two boolean literals, case sensitive: <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. It should be obvious what those mean. We'll talk more about those when we get to control flow
            </p>
