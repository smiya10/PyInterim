    <h1>Types in Python</h1>
    <p>
    While Python does not require you to specify the type of a variable, that does not mean that variables are typeless. Python has a very clear idea of types, it simply figures out your variables type at 
    runtime. The first data types we will cover are: booleans, floats, ints, strings
    </p>
    
    <h1>Numeric Types</h1>
    <p>
    Python's two main numeric types are integers and floating point numbers. An <em>integer</em> is the same as in mathematics, a number with no part past the decimal point. Examples of integers include 2 and
    78. A <em>float</em> is any number with a decimal part. 4.5 and 1.396 are both floats and, to Python, so is 2.0. The main difference between these two is what operators support them. For all arithmetic
    purposes, they are the same. For other uses, covered later, only integers are acceptable. Booleans are variables which represents true and false, represented by the literals True and False 
    (case-sensitive), are also numeric types. Internally, True corresponds to 1 and False to 0, and can be used as such.  
    </p>
    
    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <p>
    Strings are values which represent text, enclosed in either "" or ''. There are a subset of sequence data, which we will cover later. Unlike all the other types mentioned, strings are not numeric. They
    are mainly used as messages in input/output statements.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Type Conversion</h1>
    <p>
    There are many situations in which the type of one variable may be inappropriate for the task. In these scenarios, we may use a <em>type conversion</em> to change the type of our variable. Suppose we
    wanted to covert a variable <code>a = 5</code> to a string. We can call the str() method on a to get the string form of the number, like so: <code> a = str(a) </code>. Note that the str() method does not
    change the value of a, but instead returns the converted value. There are similar methods for other data types: float() and int(). These methods will not work on every piece of data, and converting
    between two incompatible types is a <em>value error</em>. You must ensure that the types are correct before you decide to convert.
