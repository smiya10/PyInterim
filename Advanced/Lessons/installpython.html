    <h1>Python Installation and Setup</h1>
    <h2>On Linux</h2>
    <p>
        Open up your terminal (Go to your menu and type terminal). Now, type <code>python --version</code>. If you see 'Python 3.something' you're good. If you see 'Python 2.something', try
        <code>python3 --version</code>. <strong>If, any point, you get <em>command not found</em>, you need to install python.</strong>
        <h3>Installing Python</h3>
        <p> Go <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/"> here</a> and download <strong>Gzipped source tarball</strong>. Once it downloads, click the download. You should see the file 
        and an extract button. Press Extract and note where the files are. Then, open up your terminal and follow the instructions in the readme.
        </p>

    <h2>On Windows</h2>
    <p>
        Unless you've installed Python before, you don't have Python. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/">This</a> is the website to install the correct version of Python. You want
        to install the Windows <strong>executable</strong> installer. If you have a 64-bit machine, you want the <em>x86</em> version. If you have a 32-bit machine, or just don't know, install the regular 
        <em>x86</em>. Click the download as you normally would and follow the instructions.
    </p>
    <h2>On Mac</h2>
    <p>
    Apple is weird, and I don't have a Mac, so follow <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/">these instructions</a>. Steps 1-5 are necessary, the others are useful.
