    <h1>Python Installation and Setup</h1>
    <h2>On Linux</h2>
    <p>
        Open up your terminal (Go to your menu and type terminal). Now, type <code>python --version</code>. If you see 'Python 3.something' you're good. If you see 'Python 2.something', try
        <code>python3 --version</code>. <strong>If, any point, you get <em>command not found</em>, you need to install python.</strong>
        <h3>Installing Python</h3>
        <p> Go <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/"> here</a> and download <strong>Gzipped source tarball</strong>. Once it downloads, click the download. You should see the file 
        and an extract button. Press Extract and note where the files are. Then, open up your terminal and follow the instructions in the readme.
        </p>
        <h3>Using Python</h3>
        <p> My preferred way of running python is by using a text editor and running the python or python3 (whichever one runs Python 3.x). See the "Hello World" lesson for more info</p> 
    </p>
    <h2>On Windows</h2>
    <p>
        Unless you've installed Python before, you don't have Python. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/">This</a> is the website to install the correct version of Python. You want
        to install the Windows <strong>executable</strong> installer. If you have a 64-bit machine, you want the <em>x86</em> version. If you have a 32-bit machine, or just don't know, install the regular 
        <em>x86</em>. Click the download as you normally would and follow the instructions. <br>
        To run Python, go the start menu and type IDLE. This should pull up the Python Interpreter. In the toolbar, click File->New File to create a new file. This is how you will edit your Python programs.
        In the file, click Run->Run Module to run your program. See the next lesson for more info.
    </p>
    <h2>On Mac</h2>
    <p>
    Apple is weird, and I don't have a Mac, so follow <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/">these instructions</a>. Steps 1-5 are necessary, the others are useful.
