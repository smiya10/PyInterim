# PyInterim
Information and lessons for the python bootcamp held at SCGSSM in the 2017 Interim.
This repository will contain the formatted lesson plans for the pseudo-official Python bootcamp at the South Carolina Governor's 
School for Science and Mathematics (SCGSSM). This program will be held during the 2017 Interim, but is in no way an Interim class
nor a class offered by SCGSSM or taught by an SCGSSM faculty member.

# What is this "bootcamp" you speak of?
Brennan Cain is teaching a course in robotic control systems during the SCGSSM Spring Semester. His class is using Python, but does
not require a Python based class for enrollment. Hunter Damron and I, Sydney Miyasaki, are going to hold a small series of lectures
and lessons for SCGSSM students who are interested in learning Python to prepare for this class. This class is, however, open to
any SCGSSM student who wishes to attend. We will not schedule any meetings during Interim classes. If you happened to find this 
repo and aren't an SCGSSM student or are not reading this in January 2017, then none of this applies to you.

# Who are these materials for?
The above section should partially answer this, but if that section does not apply to you, no worries! These materials will be 
written so that anyone can use and read them. That's why they're on GitHub. The material is designed for students who have a 101
level of programming knowledge, so basic concepts like "what a function is" will not be explained. That being said, it is also not 
likely to be an advanced course. Don't read these expecting information on advanced topics like generators. The material covered
will be for a robotics class, so topics like regular expressions and string parsing are not top priority here. All that being said,
these materials should help most anyone learn basic Python. 

# Are there any licensing restrictions?
No. Feel free to use these materials however you want. Teach your own class. Add your own stuff. Do whatever. Just don't attribute 
work to the authors that we did not do. Giving us credit for what you use would also be nice, but no one will hunt you down if you
don't.
